Chapter 10: General Issues In Using Variables
=============================================

Checklist: General Considerations In Using Data
-----------------------------------------------

### Initializing Variables

- Does each routine check input parameters for validity?

- Does the code declare variables close to where they’re first used?

- Does the code initialize variables as they’re declared, if possible?

- Does the code initialize variables close to where they’re first used, if it isn’t possible to declare and initialize them at the same time?

- Are counters and accumulators initialized properly and, if necessary, reinitialized each time they are used?

- Are variables reinitialized properly in code that’s executed repeatedly?

- Does the code compile with no warnings from the compiler?

- If your language uses implicit declarations, have you compensated for the problems they cause?

### Other General Issues in Using Data

- Do all variables have the smallest scope possible?

- Are references to variables as close together as possible -- both from each reference to a variable to the next and in total live time?

- Do control structures correspond to the data types?

- Are all the declared variables being used?

- Are all variables bound at appropriate times, that is, striking a conscious balance between the flexibility of late binding and the increased complexity associated with late binding?

- Does each variable have one and only one purpose?

- Is each variable’s meaning explicit, with no hidden meanings?
