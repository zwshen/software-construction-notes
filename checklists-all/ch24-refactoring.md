Chapter 24: Refactoring
=======================

Reasons to Refactor
-------------------
- Code is duplicated

- A routine is too long

- A loop is too long or too deeply nested

- A class has poor cohesion

- A class interface does not provide a consistent level of abstraction

- A parameter list has too many parameters

- Changes within a class tend to be compartmentalized

- Changes require parallel modifications to multiple classes

- Inheritance hierarchies have to be modified in parallel

- Related data items that are used together are not organized into classes

- A routine uses more features of another class than of its own class

- A primitive data type is overloaded

- A class doesn’t do very much

- A chain of routines passes tramp data

- A middle man object isn’t doing anything

- One class is overly intimate with another

- A routine has a poor name

- Data members are public

- A subclass uses only a small percentage of its parents’ routines

- Comments are used to explain difficult code

- Global variables are used

- A routine uses setup code before a routine call or takedown code after a routine call

- A program contains code that seems like it might be needed someday

Summary of Refactorings
-----------------------

### Data Level Refactorings

- Replace a magic number with a named constant

- Rename a variable with a clearer or more informative name

- Move an expression inline

- Replace an expression with a routine

- Introduce an intermediate variable

- Convert a multi-use variable to a multiple single-use variables

- Use a local variable for local purposes rather than a parameter

- Convert a data primitive to a class

- Convert a set of type codes to a class

- Convert a set of type codes to a class with subclasses

- Change an array to an object

- Encapsulate a collection

- Replace a traditional record with a data class

### Statement Level Refactorings

- Decompose a boolean expression

- Move a complex boolean expression into a well-named boolean function

- Consolidate fragments that are duplicated within different parts of a conditional

- Use break or return instead of a loop control variable

- Return as soon as you know the answer instead of assigning a return value within nested if-then-else statements

- Replace conditionals with polymorphism (especially repeated case statements)

- Create and use null objects instead of testing for null values

### Routine Level Refactorings

- Extract a routine

- Move a routine’s code inline

- Convert a long routine to a class

- Substitute a simple algorithm for a complex algorithm

- Add a parameter

- Remove a parameter

- Separate query operations from modification operations

- Combine similar routines by parameterizing them

- Separate routines whose behavior depends on parameters passed in

- Pass a whole object rather than specific fields

- Pass specific fields rather than a whole object

- Encapsulate downcasting

### Class Implementation Refactorings

- Change value objects to reference objects

- Change reference objects to value objects

- Replace virtual routines with data initialization

- Change member routine or data placement

- Extract specialized code into a subclass

- Combine similar code into a superclass

### Class Interface Refactorings

- Move a routine to another class

- Convert one class to two

- Eliminate a class

- Hide a delegate

- Replace inheritance with delegation

- Replace delegation with inheritance

- Remove a middle man

- Introduce a foreign routine

- Introduce a class extension

- Encapsulate an exposed member variable

- Remove Set() routines for fields that cannot be changed

- Hide routines that are not intended to be used outside the class

- Encapsulate unused routines

- Collapse a superclass and subclass if their implementations are very similar

### System Level Refactorings

- Duplicate data you can’t control

- Change unidirectional class association to bidirectional class association

- Change bidirectional class association to unidirectional class association

- Provide a factory routine rather than a simple constructor

- Replace error codes with exceptions or vice versa

Checklist: Refactoring Safely
-----------------------------

- Is each change part of a systematic change strategy?

- Did you save the code you started with before beginning refactoring?

- Are you keeping each refactoring small?

- Are you doing refactorings one at a time?

- Have you made a list of steps you intend to take during your refactoring?

- Do you have a parking lot so that you can remember ideas that occur to you mid-refactoring?

- Have you retested after each refactoring?

- Have changes been reviewed if they are complicated or if they affect mission-critical code?

- Have you considered the riskiness of the specific refactoring, and adjusted your approach accordingly?

- Does the change enhance the program’s internal quality rather than degrading it?

- Have you avoided using refactoring as a cover for code and fix or as an excuse for not rewriting bad code?
