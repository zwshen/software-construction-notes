-----------------------------------

- Have you identified specific quality characteristics that are important to your project?

- Have you made others aware of the projects quality objectives?

- Have you differentiated between external and internal quality characteristics?

- Have you thought about the ways in which some characteristics may compete with or complement others?

- Does your project call for the use of several different error-detection techniques suited to finding several different kinds of errors?

- Does your project include a plan to take steps to assure software quality during each stage of software development?

- Is the quality measured in some way so that you can tell whether its improving or degrading?

- Does management understand that quality assurance incurs additional costs up front in order to save costs later?
