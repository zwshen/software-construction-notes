Chapter 25: Code-Tuning Strategies
==================================

Checklist: Code-Tuning Strategy
-------------------------------

### Overall Program Performance

- Have you considered improving performance by changing the program requirements?

- Have you considered improving performance by modifying the program’s design?

- Have you considered improving performance by modifying the class design?

- Have you considered improving performance by avoiding operating system interactions?

- Have you considered improving performance by avoiding I/O?

- Have you considered improving performance by using a compiled language instead of an interpreted language?

- Have you considered improving performance by using compiler optimizations?

- Have you considered improving performance by switching to different hardware?

- Have you considered code tuning only as a last resort?

### Code-Tuning Approach

- Is your program fully correct before you begin code tuning?

- Have you measured performance bottlenecks before beginning code tuning?

- Have you measured the effect of each code-tuning change?

- Have you backed out the code-tuning changes that didn’t produce the intended improvement?

- Have you tried more than one change to improve performance of each bottleneck, i.e., iterated?
