Chapter 4: Key Construction Decisions
=====================================

Checklist: Major Construction Practices
---------------------------------------

The following checklist summarizes the specific practices you should consciously decide to include or exclude during construction.
Details of the practices are contained throughout Code Complete 2nd Ed.

### Coding

- Have you defined coding conventions for names, comments, and formatting?

- Have you defined specific coding practices that are implied by the architecture, such as how error conditions will be handled, how security will be addressed, and so on?

- Have you identified your location on the technology wave and adjusted your approach to match? If necessary, have you identified how you will program into the language rather than being limited by programming in it?

### Teamwork

- Have you defined an integration procedure, that is, have you defined the specific steps a programmer must go through before checking code into the master sources?

- Will programmers program in pairs, or individually, or some combination of the two?

### Quality Assurance

- Will programmers write test cases for their code before writing the code itself?

- Will programmers write unit tests for their code regardless of whether they write them first or last?

- Will programmers step through their code in the debugger before they check it in?

- Will programmers integration-test their code before they check it in?

- Will programmers review or inspect each others’ code?

### Tools

- Have you selected a revision control tool?

- Have you selected a language and language version or compiler version?

- Have you decided whether to allow use of non-standard language features?

- Have you identified and acquired other tools you’ll be using editor, refactoring tool, debugger, test framework, syntax checker, and so on?
