Chapter 17: Unusual Control Structures
======================================

Checklist: Unusual Control Structures
-------------------------------------

### return

- Does each routine use return only when necessary?

- Do returns enhance readability?

### Recursion

- Does the recursive routine include code to stop the recursion?

- Does the routine use a safety counter to guarantee that the routine stops?

- Is recursion limited to one routine?

- Is the routine’s depth of recursion within the limits imposed by the size of the program’s stack?

- Is recursion the best way to implement the routine? Is it better than simple iteration?

### goto

- Are gotos used only as a last resort, and then only to make code more readable and maintainable?

- If a goto is used for the sake of efficiency, has the gain in efficiency been measured and documented?

- Are gotos limited to one label per routine?

- Do all gotos go forward, not backward?

- Are all goto labels used?
