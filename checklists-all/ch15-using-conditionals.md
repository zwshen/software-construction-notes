Chapter 15: Using Conditionals
==============================

Checklist: Conditionals
-----------------------

### if-then Statements

- Is the nominal path through the code clear?

- Do if-then tests branch correctly on equality?

- Is the else clause present and documented?

- Is the else clause correct?

- Are the if and else clauses used correctly -- not reversed?

- Does the normal case follow the if rather than the else?

### if-then-else-if Chains

- Are complicated tests encapsulated in boolean function calls?

- Are the most common cases tested first?

- Are all cases covered?

- Is the if-then-else-if chain the best implementation -- better than a case statement?

### case Statements

- Are cases ordered meaningfully?

- Are the actions for each case simple-calling other routines if necessary?

- Does the case statement test a real variable, not a phony one thatâ€™s made up solely to use and abuse the case statement?

- Is the use of the default clause legitimate?

- Is the default clause used to detect and report unexpected cases?

- In C, C++, or Java, does the end of each case have a break?
