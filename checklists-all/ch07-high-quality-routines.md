Chapter 7: High-Quality Routines
================================

Checklist: High-Quality Routines
--------------------------------

### Big-Picture Issues

- Is the reason for creating the routine sufficient?

- Have all parts of the routine that would benefit from being put into routines of their own been put into routines of their own?

- Is the routine’s name a strong, clear verb-plus-object name for a procedure or a description of the return value for a function?

- Does the routine’s name describe everything the routine does?

- Have you established naming conventions for common operations?

- Does the routine have strong, functional cohesion -- doing one and only one thing and doing it well?

- Do the routines have loose coupling -- are the routine’s connections to other routines small, intimate, visible, and flexible?

- Is the length of the routine determined naturally by its function and logic, rather than by an artificial coding standard?

### Parameter-Passing Issues

- Does the routine’s parameter list, taken as a whole, present a consistent interface abstraction?

- Are the routine’s parameters in a sensible order, including matching the order of parameters in similar routines?

- Are interface assumptions documented?

- Does the routine have seven or fewer parameters?

- Is each input parameter used?

- Is each output parameter used?

- Does the routine avoid using input parameters as working variables?

- If the routine is a function, does it return a valid value under all possible circumstances?
