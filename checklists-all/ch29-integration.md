Chapter 29: Integration
=======================

Checklist: Integration
----------------------

### Integration Strategy

- Does the strategy identify the optimal order in which subsystems, classes, and routines should be integrated?

- Is the integration order coordinated with the construction order so that classes will be ready for integration at the right time?

- Does the strategy lead to easy diagnosis of defects?

- Does the strategy keep scaffolding to a minimum?

- Is the strategy better than other approaches?

- Have the interfaces between components been specified well? (Specifying interfaces isn’t an integration task, but verifying that they have been specified well is.)

### Daily Build and Smoke Test

- Is the project building frequently -- ideally, daily to support incremental integration?

- Is a smoke test run with each build so that you know whether the build works?

- Have you automated the build and the smoke test?

- Do developers check in their code frequently -- going no more than a day or two between check-ins?

- Is a broken build a rare occurrence?

- Do you build and smoke test the software even when you’re under pressure?
