Chapter 32: Self-Documenting Code
=================================

Checklist: Good Commenting Technique
------------------------------------

### General

- Can someone pick up the code and immediately start to understand it?

- Do comments explain the code’s intent or summarize what the code does, rather than just repeating the code?

- Is the Pseudocode Programming Process used to reduce commenting time?

- Has tricky code been rewritten rather than commented?

- Are comments up to date?

- Are comments clear and correct?

- Does the commenting style allow comments to be easily modified?

### Statements and Paragraphs

- Does the code avoid endline comments?

- Do comments focus on why rather than how?

- Do comments prepare the reader for the code to follow?

- Does every comment count? Have redundant, extraneous, and self-indulgent comments been removed or improved?

- Are surprises documented?

- Have abbreviations been avoided?

- Is the distinction between major and minor comments clear?

- Is code that works around an error or undocumented feature commented?

### Data Declarations

- Are units on data declarations commented?

- Are the ranges of values on numeric data commented?

- Are coded meanings commented?

- Are limitations on input data commented?

- Are flags documented to the bit level?

- Has each global variable been commented where it is declared?

- Has each global variable been identified as such at each usage, by a naming convention, a comment, or both?

- Are magic numbers replaced with named constants or variables rather than just documented?

### Control Structures

- Is each control statement commented?

- Are the ends of long or complex control structures commented or, when possible, simplified so that they don’t need comments?

### Routines

- Is the purpose of each routine commented?

- Are other facts about each routine given in comments, when relevant, including input and output data, interface assumptions, limitations, error corrections, global effects, and sources of algorithms?

### Files, Classes, and Programs

- Does the program have a short document such as that described in the Book Paradigm that gives an overall view of how the program is organized?

- Is the purpose of each file described?

- Are the author’s name, email address, and phone number in the listing?

Checklist: Self-Documenting Code
--------------------------------

### Classes

- Does the class’s interface present a consistent abstraction?

- Is the class well named, and does its name describe its central purpose?

- Does the class’s interface make obvious how you should use the class?

- Is the class’s interface abstract enough that you don’t have to think about how its services are implemented?

- Can you treat the class as a black box?

### Routines

- Does each routine’s name describe exactly what the routine does?

- Does each routine perform one well-defined task?

- Have all parts of each routine that would benefit from being put into their own routines been put into their own routines?

- Is each routine’s interface obvious and clear?

### Data Names

- Are type names descriptive enough to help document data declarations?

- Are variables named well?

- Are variables used only for the purpose for which they’re named?

- Are loop counters given more informative names than i, j, and k?

- Are well-named enumerated types used instead of makeshift flags or boolean variables?

- Are named constants used instead of magic numbers or magic strings?

- Do naming conventions distinguish among type names, enumerated types, named constants, local variables, class variables, and global variables?

### Data Organization

- Are extra variables used for clarity when needed?

- Are references to variables close together?

- Are data types simple so that they minimize complexity?

- Is complicated data accessed through abstract access routines (abstract data types)?

### Control

- Is the nominal path through the code clear?

- Are related statements grouped together?

- Have relatively independent groups of statements been packaged into their own routines?

- Does the normal case follow the if rather than the else?

- Are control structures simple so that they minimize complexity?

- Does each loop perform one and only one function, as a well-defined routine would?

- Is nesting minimized?

- Have boolean expressions been simplified by using additional boolean variables, boolean functions, and decision tables?

### Layout

- Does the program’s layout show its logical structure?

### Design

- Is the code straightforward, and does it avoid cleverness?

- Are implementation details hidden as much as possible?

- Is the program written in terms of the problem domain as much as possible rather than in terms of computer-science or programming-language structures?
