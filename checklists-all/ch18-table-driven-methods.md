Chapter 18: Table Driven Methods
================================

Checklist: Table Driven Methods
-------------------------------

- Have you considered table-driven methods as an alternative to complicated logic?

- Have you considered table-driven methods as an alternative to complicated inheritance structures?

- Have you considered storing the tableâ€™s data externally and reading it at run time so that the data can be modified without changing code?

- If the table cannot be accessed directly via a straightforward array index (as in the Age example), have your put the access-key calculation into a routine rather than duplicating the index calculation in the code?
