Chapter 19: General Control Issues
==================================

Checklist: Control Structure Issues
-----------------------------------

- Do expressions use True and False rather than 1 and 0?

- Are boolean values compared to True and False implicitly?

- Are numeric values compared to their test values explicitly?

- Have expressions been simplified by the addition of new boolean variables and the use of boolean functions and decision tables?

- Are boolean expressions stated positively?

- Do pairs of braces balance?

- Are braces used everywhere theyâ€™re needed for clarity?

- Are logical expressions fully parenthesized?

- Have tests been written in number-line order?

- Do Java tests uses a.equals(b) style instead of a == b when appropriate?

- Are null statements obvious?

- Have nested statements been simplified by retesting part of the conditional, converting to if-then-else or case statements, moving nested code into its own routine, converting to a more object-oriented design, or improved in some other way?

- If a routine has a decision count of more than 10, is there a good reason for not redesigning it?
