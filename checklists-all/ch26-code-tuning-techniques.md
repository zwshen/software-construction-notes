Chapter 26: Code Tuning Techniques
==================================

Checklist: Code-Tuning Techniques
---------------------------------

### Improve Both Speed and Size

- Substitute table lookups for complicated logic

- Jam loops

- Use integer instead of floating-point variables

- Initialize data at compile time

- Use constants of the correct type

- Precompute results

- Eliminate common subexpressions

- Translate key routines to assembler

### Improve Speed Only

- Stop testing when you know the answer

- Order tests in case statements and if-then-else chains by frequency

- Compare performance of similar logic structures

- Use lazy evaluation

- Unswitch loops that contain if tests

- Unroll loops

- Minimize work performed inside loops

- Use sentinels in search loops

- Put the busiest loop on the inside of nested loops

- Reduce the strength of operations performed inside loops

- Change multiple-dimension arrays to a single dimension

- Minimize array references

- Augment data types with indexes

- Cache frequently used values

- Exploit algebraic identities

- Reduce strength in logical and mathematical expressions

- Be wary of system routines

- Rewrite routines in line
